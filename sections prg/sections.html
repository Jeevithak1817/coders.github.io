      <h4>₹300 Crore Worth Drugs Seized near Gujarat Coast</h4>
      <p>Off the coast of Gujarat, in the wee hours of Monday, the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) apprehended a Pakistani boat with 10 crew members who were carrying weapons, ammunition, and 40 kg of drugs worth $300 million.
        Based on specific information supplied by the ATS, a combined team of the ATS and the ICG took action. The Coast Guard then sent its rapid patrol ship, “ICGS Arinjay,” for patrolling in the vicinity of the International Maritime Border Line (IMBL), during the night of December 25 and 26.
        The Pakistani fishing boat “Al Soheli” was seen moving suspiciously in Indian waters early in the day, according to a news statement from the ICG. When confronted by the ICG ship, the boat began evasive manoeuvre and did not stop even after warning shots were fired.
        The ICG guards boarded the boat for examination after the Coast Guard ultimately managed to intercept and halt the vessel.
        The boat and crew are being sent to Gujarat’s Okha port for additional examination.
        This was the seventh collaborative operation between the ICG and Gujarat ATS in the previous 18 months, and it was the first time that narcotics and weapons, and ammunition were also recovered.
        In the past 18 months, 44 Pakistani and seven Iranian crew members have been detained together with 346 kilos of heroin worth Rs. 1,930 crore.

      <h4>China Covid: US considers restrictions on Chinese arrivals</h4>
      <p>The US is considering imposing new Covid restrictions on Chinese arrivals, after Beijing announced it would reopen its borders next month.
        American officials say this is due to a lack of transparency surrounding the virus in China, as cases surge.
        Japan, Malaysia and Taiwan - worried at importing Covid cases - have already outlined tighter measures for Chinese travellers, including negative tests.
        Beijing has said Covid rules should be brought in on a "scientific" basis.
        India is also stepping up measures for Chinese arrivals, but this was announced before Beijing said it would relax its strict border policy.
        Passport applications for Chinese citizens wishing to travel internationally will resume from 8 January, the country's immigration authorities have said.
        Travel sites have reported a spike in traffic, leaving some countries fearful over the potential spread of Covid.

      <h4>Mixer Blast Tears Off Man’s Hand In Karnataka</h4>
      <p>A guy lost his hand due to a mixer-grinder explosion on Monday night in Kevempunagar Extension, Karnataka. The event happened when the mixer-grinder was being tested by the guy, Shashi, who manages a DTDC branch office. The explosion tore off Shashi’s right hand and broke the office’s windows. According to the police, Shashi attempted to examine a package that had been returned by a client two days prior and contained the mixer.
        According to Superintendent of Police (SP) Hariram Shankar, Shashi is now safe. A consumer returned the product on the grounds that it had been delivered to the wrong address.
        A team from the Mysuru Forensic Science Lab has been informed of the situation, and they will begin an inquiry on Tuesday. There are no suspicions based on the preliminary investigation.
        The actual cause of the explosion will be determined after a thorough investigation.

      <h4>India's GDP is slowing down: How it combats the slowdown would decide its economic future</h4>
      <p>On December 7, when Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das announced the hiking of the repo rate (the rate at which the central bank lends to other banks) by 35 basis points to 6.25 per cent, heads nodded in agreement, as the hike was on expected lines. But what mildly raised eyebrows was his announcement of a cut in the gross domestic product (GDP) growth projection for FY23 to 6.8 per cent from 7 per cent forecast in September. In fact, the 7 per cent itself was a step down from the 7.2 per cent that the central bank had held earlier (in April), and not because of continuing challenges such as external geopolitical disturbances impacting India’s exports, inflation, etc.
        In fact, the GDP growth rate for Q2 of FY23, which was announced six days before the governor’s address, slowed to 6.3 per cent—from 13.5 per cent in Q1 of FY23 and 8.4 per cent in Q2 of FY22. But that seems not to have worried anyone because it was on expected lines. “Interestingly, the GVA (gross value added) growth figures were 70 bps short of the GDP numbers. This may be due to higher tax collections as GDP is GVA plus net taxes,” points out Sanjay Kumar, Partner, Tax and Public Policy Leader at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India. “Higher tax collections are good and bode well for the current financial year. It is another sign of a good recovery.”
